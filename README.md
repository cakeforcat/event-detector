# event-detector
A simple tool for detecting events in a data time series

Created as a project for a 1st year UG EEE software design module at <br/>
University of Strathclyde<br/>

It accepts specific .csv files as seen in [here](https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/datasets/refit-electrical-load-measurements)
<br/>
please don't judge, I am fully aware that the code looks bad, I can barely understand it myself.
